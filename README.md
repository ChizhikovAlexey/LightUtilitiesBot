# ![Home_Creative_Tail.svg.png](house.png) Light Utilities Bot 

Light version of my UtilitesBot. No unnecessary technologies and frameworks. Relies mostly on Spring Dependency Injection and pure PostgreSQL.
I use this implementation for my needs.

## Features:
* Read, write and delete information about utilities meters from/to databse;
* Generate monthly reports;
* Buttons instead of /commands; 
* Update tariffs;
* Export data to OpenDocument Spreadsheet file in a convenient structure.

## Stack:
* Maven;
* TelegramBots library from @rubenlagus;
* PostgreSQL database;
* Spring Framework (Dependency Injection);
* DotEnv (.env file and environment variables handling);
* SODS library (to work with .ods files);
* Lombok;
* Slf4j logging.

I have no objection to your using of my code for any purpose.
